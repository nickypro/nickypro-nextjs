Hey, I'm Nicky

I'm currently doing AI Safety research on an independant grant after finishing my BA Theoretical Physics at Trinity College Dublin. If you are interested in AI safety, or think my various skills in maths/physics, front-end and back-end programming, or ML knowledge could be of impact, feel free to reach out!
